# JavaScript Music Player
This project is a simple JavaScript-based music player that allows users to play, pause, skip tracks, shuffle the playlist, and manage their song library. The player comes with a user-friendly interface and is easy to customize.

Shuffle Button (shuffle): Randomizes the order of songs in the playlist.  

## Playlist Management:
The playlist is visibly displayed, presenting song titles, artists, and durations.
Clicking on a song in the playlist will start playing that particular track.
Each song in the playlist has a delete button for easy removal.

## Reset Playlist:
If the playlist becomes empty, a "Reset Playlist" button appears to restore the original list of songs.

## Accessibility Features:

Aria attributes are utilized to enhance the user experience for screen readers.
